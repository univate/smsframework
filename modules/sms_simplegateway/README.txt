This module may require additional testing and better documentation to make it easier to grasp for non-developers.

The rationale for this module is that many (or most) SMS gateway services use basic HTTP GET or POST requests, the only difference being the names of the HTTP parameters. This module allows the user to specify the parameter names for sending and receiving messages, so that they dont have to write a gateway module.
