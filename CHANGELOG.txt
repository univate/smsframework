Changes to SMS Framework core module (sms) and complimentary module set

See the CHANGELOG.txt in each complimentary module for module-specific changes.

-----------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES SINCE 6.x-1.0
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Added constants for message direction codes, message status codes, gateway response codes.
- Added function: sms_dir() to help render the sms direction constants.
- Modified sms_send()
    - Now passes $gateway and $options to sms_handle_result()
    - Added post-process hook: hook_sms_send_process(). Hook name chosen to preserve backward-compatibility, since hook_sms_send() does not implement the standard $op values ('pre process', 'process', 'post process').
- Modified sms_handle_result()
    - Added $gateway and $options to @params, with default values.
    - Logging failed messages is now optional, as per admin setting, enabled by default.
    - Return either a full response array if an option is given in $options, or the usual TRUE/FALSE. Response array includes message info, gateway array, status values from the gateway and the associated SMS Framework gateway status code.
- Modified sms_validate_number()
    - Added additional formatting to catch error cases more easily.
    - Added hook_sms_validate() with pre-process, process and post-process operations.
- Added function: sms_receipt() that provides hook_sms_receipt()
- Removed function: sms_formatter(). This function is redundant, since validation functions will format the number.
- sms_send_form() will only include the ruleset (country) selector if it needs to (if there are rulesets and/or admin setting enabled). Default is 'auto-select'.
- sms_send_form_validate(): Made it call the main validation function sms_validate_number() and carry any number manipulation made by the validation methods.
- Added include file: sms.admin.inc
- Moved admin settings form functions to sms.admin.inc file
- Added a core admin settings form
- Added admin setting for sms_send_form with ruleset (country) selector on/off and configurable field title.

- Added module: sms_actions
- Added module: sms_devel
- Added module: sms_txtlocal
- Added module: sms_valid

TODO
- What if the gateway always returns a message id code? We should be able to capture this.
- sms_send_form() to show ruleset selector only the form previously validated false. Requires some Drupal form tricks.
- Change sender/receiver options keys to be 'gw_number' - this requires a change in all feature modules and all gateway modules that support incoming messages.
- Allow gateway send function to modify the $options variable, to carry on for post-processing.
- DONE Change virtual gateway to use gw_number = 99999
- DONE Virtual gateway should have a lower-case G
- DONE Virtual gateway: remove default reference set and ensure that other calls to $options['reference'] are handled correctly in the module.
- DONE Virtual gateway seems to be overwriting the reference tags.
- DONE Virtual gateway 'gateway_number' to 'gw_number'.
- DONE sms_track must accept simple gateway response (true/false)
- SMS Tracking receipts are not UPDATEing for some weird reason.
- sms_devel Send Form must request full gateway response
- Virtual gateway to set a default gw_number
- DONE SMS Tracking purge hook_cron
